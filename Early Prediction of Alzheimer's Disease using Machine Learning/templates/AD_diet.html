      <p class="w3-large" style="text-align:justify;">Seniors with Alzheimer’s may not remember to eat, and at times they may not seem to have much of an appetite. However, the right diet provides a combination of nutrients that can enhance brain health and inhibit further neuronal damage. The Mediterranean Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) and DASH diets include a selection of specific foods proven to benefit the brain. These diets offer a wide choice of food groups to create delicious and healthy meals.

      <h1 class="w3-center">Nutritious Diet Plan</h1><br>
      <h4 style="color:Green;">Dark Leafy Greens </h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Arugula, collard, kale, mustard greens, and spinach contain vitamin B9, which seems to increase cognition and memory in seniors and also prevents depression. Dark greens contain vitamin E that protects brain tissue from inflammation and oxidative stress, which is commonly seen in seniors with Alzheimer’s. Should be taken at least 6 servings per week. </p><br>
    
      <h4 style="color:Orange;">Cruciferous And Other Vegetables </h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower contain vitamin B9 along with carotenoids. These compounds are known to lower the levels of the amino acid homocysteine, which has been associated with cognitive decline. Carrots, tomatoes, and other bright-colored vegetables also offer an abundance of nutrients. Should be taken atleast one serving per day </p><br>
    
      <h4 style="color:lightgreen;">Beans  </h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Legumes are a wonderful source of iron, magnesium, and potassium, in addition to vitamin B9 and choline. Choline boosts levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is necessary for proper brain function. Advised to be taken atleast 3 servings per week. </p><br>
    
      <h4 style="color:Red;">Berries And Cherries </h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Red, blue, and purple fruits contain anthocyanin. This phytochemical compound protects delicate brain tissue from inflammation, oxidative stress, and radiation damage. Blueberries, cherries, raspberries, and strawberries are also a great source of fiber along with vitamins C and E. Good to take atleast 2 times per week. </p><br>
    
      <h4 style="color:Brown;">Fish </h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Herring, salmon, and sardines belong to the oily fish category. Oily fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which keep the brain in optimal working condition. These nutrients also inhibit brain lesion development. Must consume atleast once in a week. </p>
