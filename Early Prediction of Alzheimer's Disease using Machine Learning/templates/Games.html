      <h1 style="color:Dodgerblue">Reading & Writing</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="color:white">According to researchers, reading is neurologically more efficient than processing images. Reading involves many brain functions like vision, language, and associative learning. Putting pen to paper requires eye and cognitive coordination, so does writing on a computer. Here are some ideas to encourage more reading and writing:
<br><br>
<b><i>Make reading a daily activity</b></i> : Whether it is a newspaper or a book, it is good to read every day.<a href="https://www.ihps.com/best-books-seniors/" target="_blank" style="color:tomato;font-size:15px;font-style:italic;">(click here)</a><br><br>
<b><i>Join a book club</b></i> : This not only encourages reading, but also social interaction with others as well.<a href="https://bookclubz.com/join-a-book-club" target="_blank" style="color:tomato;font-size:15px;font-style:italic;" >(click here)</font></a><br><br>
<b><i>Keep a journal</b> </i>: Write out "What happened, what did you do? Any special accomplishments? What surprised you; what did you observe or learn?" in a diary or a notebook. This helps remember and recollect lot of our memories that our brain tend to forget. <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&ContentTypeID=1" target="_blank" style="color:tomato;font-size:15px;font-style:italic;">(click here)</a><br><br>
<b><i>Write a memoir</b></i> : This is a great way to share your life story with younger family members and to the world if you like.<a href="http://www.memoirtoolkit.com/" target="_blank" style="color:tomato;font-size:15px;font-style:italic;">(click here)</a><br><br>
<b><i>Handwrite cards & letters</b></i> : In these contemporary days ,Who doesn’t appreciate a handwritten note?

      <h1 style="color:Dodgerblue">Exercise</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="color:white">Healthy body, healthy mind. We’ve heard that mantra for years. Researchers have learned that physical activity can help reduce Alzheimer’s risk by up to 65 percent. Exercise reduces the risk of blood vessel disease, improves breathing, and supports the survival of cells that make up the body and brain. Exercise also reduces chronic inflammation and improves cardiovascular health which are both risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Here are some easy exercise ideas:
<br><br>
<b><i>Stretching</b></i> : Make simple stretching a part of your daily morning routine.<br><br>
<b><i>Walking</b></i> : Walking daily – even for 15 minutes – can be very beneficial.<br><br>
<b><i>Yoga or tai chi</b></i> : These low-impact practices are also excellent for the mind, body and spirit.<br><br>
<b><i>Chair yoga</b></i> : Even more low-impact! There are books as well as online classes for guidance through these gentle stretching, breathing and balance moves. Namaste!<br><br>
<b><i>Online exercise classes</b></i> : Whether it’s cardio, abs, or simply stretching, there are innumerable free, online classes to be found.<br><br>
<b><i>Dog walking</b></i> : Offer to walk a friend or neighbor’s dog. This may give them a break and give you some extra exercise.<br><br>
<b><i>Gardening</b></i> : Gardening is great exercise and learning to plant, care for and cultivate flowers or your own vegetable garden will keep your body and your brain busy.<br><br>

<br><br>
<b><i>Museums</b></i>: Museums, art galleries and special exhibits are thought-provoking.<br><br>
